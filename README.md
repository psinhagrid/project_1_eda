The dataset file is uploaded in git and relative path is given in the program. 

The git reposetory also includes PDF of story/ blog post along with PDF format and latex format made using online pdf to latex converter. Please let me know if i have to manually program the latex file, I will learn to do it and try to implement it.  

I have also included the requirements file. 

I have used anaconda navigator's jupyter notebook, because of which the requirements.txt file  looked different compared to that of my friends. 

This is my first time using GitHub, I was having issues uploading into git. I asked some full time employee for assistance,
they helped me in making the repo and uploading my files in it. If there is some issue in opening / pulling files, please let me know and I will try to rectify it as soon as possible.
